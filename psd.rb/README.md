These benchmarks are originally from
[Bench 9000](https://github.com/jruby/bench9000).

We are using PSD.rb at revision `e14d652ddc705e865d8b2b897d618b25d78bcc7c`.
We use this old revision because we know it has interesting patterns of
meta-programming that we are interested in benchmarking. Some of these
patterns were replaced in later versions.

See also the ChunkyPNG benchmarks - we use the same version of ChunkyPNG as
in those.
